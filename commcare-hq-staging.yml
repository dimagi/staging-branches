##### REBUILDING AUTOSTAGING BRANCH AND DEPLOYING #####
#
# From your commcare-hq directory ensure that:
#   - your commcare-hq virtualenv is activated
#   - master is checked out and up to date
#
# Then run the rebuildstaging script which builds a branch named "autostaging" that contains
# all branches specified in this file.
#
# To check if your nelwy added branch causes any conflicts before pushing to autostaging, run:
#     $ scripts/rebuildstaging --no-push
#
# To rebuild autostaging and push those changes to origin (necessary for deploy), run:
#     $ scripts/rebuildstaging
#
# After rebuilding the autostaging branch, you need to deploy the new branch to staging.
#
#     $ commcare-cloud --control staging deploy
#     ##### OR #####
#     $ scripts/rebuildstaging --deploy (NOTE: `commcare-cloud` must be available in your shell)
#
#
##### RESOLVING BRANCH CONFLICTS #####
#
# First, determine where the conflict lies.
# a). branch `foo` conflicts with `master`
#       $ git checkout -b foo origin/foo
#       $ git pull origin master
#     try to resolve conflict
#       $ git push origin foo
# b). branch `foo` conflicts with branch `bar`
#     you can't just merge foo into bar or vice versa, otherwise the PR
#     for foo will contain commits from bar.  Instead make a third,
#     conflict-resolution branch:
#       $ git checkout -b foo+bar --no-track origin/foo
#       $ git pull origin bar
#     try to resolve conflict
#       $ git push origin foo+bar
#     add the branch `foo+bar` to staging.yml and move branches foo and
#     bar to right below it:
#     
#     - foo+bar
#     - foo
#     - bar
#
#     Later on branch `bar` gets merged into master and removed from staging.yml.
#     Perhaps the person who removes it also notices the `foo+bar` and does the
#     following. Otherwise anyone who comes along and sees `foo+bar` but not both
#     branches can feel free to assume the following needs to be done:
#       * Merge `foo+bar` into `foo`. Since `bar` is now merged and deleted, 
#         you want to merge the resolution into `foo`, otherwise `foo` will conflict
#         with master.
#       * Remove `foo+bar` from staging.yml. It's no longer necessary since it's
#         now a subset of `foo`.
#
# If you are unsure of how to resolve a conflict, notify the branch owner.

# FORMPLAYER
# From the formplayer, repo, call `./scripts/rebuildstaging`
# This rebuilds the `autostaging` branch of formplayer and runs the formplayer-staging job on jenkins
